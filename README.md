# Maze-of-Memory---Game

The game itself is a top-down exploration game that blends mystery, psychological horror, and puzzle mechanics. The player navigates a "metaphorical mindscape" in the form of a procedurally generated maze. The core gameplay involves finding "memory fragments" and making choices to either "Face It" or "Ignore" them. These decisions dynamically alter the maze and lead to one of three possible endings, allowing the player to explore themes of memory, consequence, and self-reflection.
